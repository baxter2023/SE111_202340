                "Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's "Ultron" global defense program.
                The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. 
                Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones." - WordPress

                "I like this movie because it shows fantasy reality of a type of futuristic superhero team battling together to defeat enemies. I like the action packed design
                of the story line. I think the drama, humour and acting is great by all characters. I like the hight-tech outline of the narrative
                that the movie is based  and the history of the Marvel Comics and the new redesigned narratives. The graphics make this movie stand out and make the scenes come to life. 
                The Avengers are a super hero group designed to help people and stop enemeys from destroying the planet. 
                This movie does not follow the 2011 - 2015 Marvel Comic books storyline issues #1 throught #10/#10A.I. 
                Although having following the previous comic book titles and characters, the inspiration is different and not adapted from the books, the directos wanted something different.
                The aspect of having the all the commic book superheors together in the film makes for an action packed movie."
